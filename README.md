# 📡 Single-Phase Low-Power Network Transformer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing a **low-power (P < 500W) single-phase network transformer**, considering both structural design and manufacturing technology. The transformer is intended for applications requiring **efficient power conversion and electrical isolation**, making it ideal for electronic equipment operating in varying ambient temperatures (10-80°C).

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Voltage & Current Regulation:** Ensures safe and stable operation between the primary and secondary circuits.
- **Galvanic Isolation:** Enhances safety by electrically separating circuits.
- **Ferromagnetic Core:** Uses **laminated silicon steel sheets (E+I type)** for optimal magnetic properties.
- **Robust Construction:** Includes an **insulating casing, windings, and core clamping system** to ensure durability.
- **Low Electromagnetic Emissions:** Offers a reliable alternative to SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supplies).

## 🎯 Applications
This transformer is suitable for a wide range of electronic devices, including:
- **High-performance audio amplifiers**
- **Measurement instruments**
- **Microwave ovens**
- **Soldering stations**
- **Mobile device chargers**
